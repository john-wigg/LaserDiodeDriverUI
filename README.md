# LaserDiodeDriverUI
This is an [EMU](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/EMU) plugin for [Micro-Manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager) to provide a graphical user interface for the [LaserDiodeDriver](https://github.com/john-wigg/LaserDiodeDriver) device adapter. This UI-plugin was designed by John Wigg and is part of the LaserEngine project by Daniel SchrÃ¶der at the FSU Jena.
